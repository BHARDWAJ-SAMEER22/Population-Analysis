# 📊 State-wise Population Analysis of India (Census 2011)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that analyzes the **state-wise and union territory-wise population of India** based on **Census 2011 data**.  
The dashboard provides key demographic insights using KPIs, bar charts, and geographical maps to help users understand population distribution across India.
